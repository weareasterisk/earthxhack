Created for those who have limited programming or technical experience and want to participate in helping to make the world a better place through innovative solutions to environmental problems, Dream is the place for you. We’ll offer a complete mini-hackathon experience, where you can join others and come up with new ideas - then design small non-technical prototypes and present them to our judging panel to win prizes. No experience or prior knowledge is required - just your drive to make cool stuff happen.",
