      "Dream is a mini-hackathon designed to allow you to focus solely on an idea and its non-technical implementation. Created for those who have limited programming or technical experience and want to participate in helping to make the world a better place through innovative solutions to environmental problems, Dream is the place for you. We’ll offer a complete mini-hackathon experience, where you can join others and come up with new ideas - then design small non-technical prototypes and present them to our judging panel to win prizes. No experience or prior knowledge is required - just your drive to make cool stuff happen.",
      "During Dream, we’ll offer workshops, talks, fun activities, meals and snacks, and that all-night ideation frenzy that hackathons are famous for.",
      "Like your ideas a lot and want to actually make them happen through technology? Carry over your idea into Build, team up with new or the same people, and become eligible for additional prizes in Build."
